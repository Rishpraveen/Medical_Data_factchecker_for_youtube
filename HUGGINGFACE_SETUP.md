## 🧬 How the Medical AI Works

### Medical Entity Recognition Pipeline
```
Video Transcript → Medical NER Model → Entities Extracted
                    ↓
    [Drugs: metformin, insulin]
    [Diseases: diabetes, hypertension]  
    [Symptoms: fatigue, dizziness]
    [Procedures: blood test, medication]
```

### Health Claim Analysis Pipeline
```
Entities + Context → Claim Extraction → Risk Assessment
                      ↓                    ↓
    "Take 1000mg vitamin D daily"    [Safe for user profile]
    "Stop diabetes medication"       [UNSAFE - contradicts user meds]
    "Try this herbal supplement"     [Caution - check interactions]
```

### Personalized Risk Assessment
```
Health Claims + User Profile → Drug Interactions Check → Final Risk Level
                                      ↓
    User takes Warfarin + Video suggests Ginkgo → HIGH RISK (bleeding)
    User has diabetes + Video suggests cinnamon → CAUTION (monitor glucose)
    User healthy + Video suggests vitamin C → SAFE (generally safe)
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Model Selection
The extension uses optimal models by default, but you can customize:

```javascript
// In medicalAnalyzer.js, you can change models:
this.medicalModel = 'microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext';
this.nerModel = 'd4data/biomedical-ner-all';

// Alternative medical models available:
// - 'dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1'
// - 'emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT'
// - 'microsoft/BiomedNLP-BiomedBERT-base-uncased-abstract'
```

### Self-Hosting Option
For maximum privacy, you can self-host the models:

1. **Install Transformers**: `pip install transformers torch`
2. **Download Models**: Models download automatically on first use
3. **Local API**: Use `transformers` library locally instead of HF API
4. **Update Extension**: Modify API endpoint to `localhost`

## 🧪 Testing the Medical AI

### Test Cases to Verify Setup

1. **Drug Interaction Test**
   - Create profile with "warfarin" medication
   - Find video mentioning "ginkgo" or "grapefruit"
   - Should show HIGH RISK warning

2. **Dosage Detection Test**
   - Find video with specific dosages ("take 500mg")
   - Should extract dosage information accurately
   - Should show in analysis results

3. **Condition Contraindication**
   - Add "diabetes" to health profile
   - Find video recommending high-sugar supplements
   - Should show CAUTION or HIGH RISK

4. **Safe Content Test**
   - Find general wellness video (exercise, sleep)
   - Should show SAFE classification
   - Should have green indicator

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "API key not configured"**
- Solution: Double-check token is saved in Settings tab
- Verify: Token should start with `hf_`

**❌ "Analysis failed" error**
- Check: Internet connection
- Verify: Hugging Face API status at [status.huggingface.co](https://status.huggingface.co)
- Try: Refresh page and try again

**❌ No medical entities detected**
- Check: Video has medical content (not general lifestyle)
- Verify: Transcript extraction worked (see popup Analysis tab)
- Note: Some videos may have minimal medical claims

**❌ Models loading slowly**
- First use: Models cold-start (30-60 seconds)
- Subsequent: Much faster (cached)
- Peak times: May be slower during high usage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to troubleshoot:

```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.setItem('medicalDebug', 'true');
// Reload extension to see detailed logs
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Improving Analysis Speed
1. **Batch Processing**: Extension analyzes in chunks for better performance
2. **Caching**: Results cached for recently analyzed videos
3. **Smart Filtering**: Only analyzes content with medical keywords
4. **Model Warm-up**: Models stay loaded for faster subsequent requests

### Accuracy Improvements
1. **Medical Database**: Continuously updated drug interaction database
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Results include confidence levels
3. **Multiple Models**: Cross-validation using multiple medical AI models
4. **User Feedback**: System learns from user corrections (locally)

## 🎓 Understanding the Results

### Risk Level Meanings
- **🟢 SAFE**: No known interactions or contraindications
